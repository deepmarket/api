All of the code that powers the servers that support deepmarket's frontends. Specifically, [PLUTO](https://github.com/deepmarket/PLUTO).

Instructions on setting the server up locally can be found on [this](https://github.com/deepmarket/PLUTO/wiki/Setting-up-deepmarket's-api-backend-for-local-development) wiki page over there.

A list of the endpoints that the server exposes can be found on the [api endpoints](https://github.com/deepmarket/api/wiki/API-Enpoints) wiki page in this repository.
